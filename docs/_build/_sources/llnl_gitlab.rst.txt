LLNL GitLab_
============

Just a smattering of notes at the moment...

  * add ssh key to my profile for SSH (add id_rsa.pub)
  * update my avatar image (Profile)
  * Most GitLab instances cannot pull-mirror, only push. Solution involves...

    * clone GitLab repo somewhere
    * setup remotes to pull from GitHub and push to GitLab
    * maybe setup a cron job to do this regularly
