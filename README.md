# TrainingCi4Ecp

A training site for working examples, documentation and use of ECP, complex-wide, continuous integration resources

To bootstrap setting up this site including supporting a number of common HPC use cases, we are using the
[BLT](https://github.com/LLNL/blt) CMake macros system to support the examples and documentation in this site.
