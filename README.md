# TrainingCi4Ecp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/betterscientificsoftware/TrainingCi4Ecp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/betterscientificsoftware/TrainingCi4Ecp)

A training site for working examples, documentation and use of ECP, complex-wide, continuous integration resources.

To bootstrap setting up this site including supporting a number of common HPC use cases, we are using the
[BLT](https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/blt-build-link-test) system to support the examples, ci-testing
and documentation used in this site.
